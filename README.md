# Daily DSA Practice 🚀

Welcome to my **Daily DSA Practice** repository! Here, I consistently solve Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems from platforms like **LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, GeeksforGeeks, and more**. This repository serves as a personal tracker for my learning journey and a resource for others looking for well-structured DSA solutions. 💡

## 📌 Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
📂 DSA-Practice
│── 📂 LeetCode
│   ├── Easy/
│   ├── Medium/
│   ├── Hard/
│   ├── topic-wise/
│── 📂 Codeforces
│── 📂 CodeChef
│── 📂 GeeksforGeeks
│── 📂 Other Platforms
│── 📜 README.md
```

Each problem is categorized based on difficulty or topic (such as arrays, DP, graphs, etc.).
